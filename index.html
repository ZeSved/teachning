  <h1>Python</h1>
  <p>What is python? this page of the website will cover the basics of the langauge. These are things that are found in
    nearly all programming languages.</p>
  <h2>Variables:</h2>
  <p>You assign variable by giving them a name, adding an equal sign and then giving the variable a value (as shown
    below):
  <pre><code>[insert variable name here] = [insert variable value here]</code></pre>
  </p>
  <p>The types of variables you need to know are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>String (text):
      <pre><code>
      x = 'hello world!'
    </code></pre>
      <p>When making a string variable, the value HAS to be within single quotes ('') or double quotes (""). If you
        want to make a string containing something like the word "you're" you just use double quotes to define the value
        and then you can freely use single quotes inside of it</p>
    </li>
    <li>Int/integer (numbers)
      <pre><code>
      x = 123
      </code></pre>
      <p>Note that while you can have a value of a variable start with a number or only be a number, you can not have a
        number at the start of a variable name. Anywhere else in the name is fine, just not as the first letter (a
        variable also cannot be named numbers).</p>
    </li>
    <li>Boolean (True or False)
      <pre><code>
      x = False
      x = True
      </code></pre>
      <p>In python, all booleans have to start with a capital letter, idk why but they do.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Array (a type of list)
      <pre><code>
      x = []
      </code></pre>
      <p>Arrays can be of any size and of any content, the only thing all arrays have in common is that they are defined
        using square brackets and you seperate the values inside by putting a comma after every value. When you add
        value into an array you simply add them as if you were to define the variable normally. Arrays can become
        complicated but these are the types you will use the most:</p>
      <p>Example of a string array:</p>
      <pre><code>
      x = ['this', 'is', 'a', 'string', 'array']
      </code></pre>
      <p>Example of a number array:</p>
      <pre><code>
      x = [12, 4, 789123, 0323]
      </code></pre>
      <p>Example of a boolean array:</p>
      <pre><code>
      x = [True, True, False]
      </code></pre>
      <p>Example of a mixed array:</p>
      <pre><code>
      x = [True, 123, 'hello', 1, False]
      </code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Object (a different type of list)
      <pre><code>
      x = {}
      </code></pre>
      <p>Objects are lists where you aslo need to give the values a name. There are two things to think about, one is
        that it is defined using curly brackets, and the other is that instead of the '=' sign when defining variables
        it uses ':'. it has the same principles as an array but the
        same variable naming rules as normal variable, an example of what an object might look like:</p>
      <pre><code>
      dog = {
        play: "likes it"
        hungry: True
        yearsOld: 6
      }
      </code></pre>
      <p>The way you would access these inner variables or 'sub variables' is by putting the object name followed by a
        period followed by the sub variable's name, example:</p>
      <pre><code>
      dog.play = 'likes it'
      </code></pre>
      <p>In the example above I'm only using using the equal sign to show that dog.play has the value of 'likes it' but
        the example also shows how you would change or 're-assign' the sub variables.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Missing data (null/undefined)
      <pre><code>
      x = null
      x = undefined
      </code></pre>
      <p>You normally only see these variable values if you encounter an error. I am honestly not even sure if you can
        assign null as a value since 'null' means that the 'item' (variables, functions, etc) doesn't exist and
        undefined
        means that the variable has not been assigned a value</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are the basic (and most used) variables and variable values. These can become advanced, such as putting in
    object inside of object, or object inside of arrays, or vice versa. They can also have the value of entire 100 line
    functions. But don't let that scare you because even if you know them really well you would rarely actually use
    them.</p>
